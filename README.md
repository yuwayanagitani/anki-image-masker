# 🧠 AI Masker for Anki (Image Masker / Grouped Occlusion)

**AI Masker** (a.k.a **Image Masker**) is an Anki add-on that lets you **create multiple image-occlusion cards at once** by drawing masks on an image and exporting them as a group — super useful for diagrams, charts, and annotated figures.

Installing from AnkiWeb is recommended for easy setup and **automatic updates**.

## 🎯 Features

- 📌 Draw **multiple masks** on a single image  
- 📦 Export all masked regions as a **group of new occlusion cards**  
- 🖼️ Designed for charts, diagrams, anatomy images, and complex visuals  
- 🎯 Saves time vs. creating occlusions one by one  
- 🔧 Integrates with Anki’s card creation workflows  

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. In the **Anki card editor**, insert an image you want to occlude.  
2. Trigger **AI Masker** to start drawing mask rectangles.  
3. Draw multiple masks covering different regions of the image.  
4. Once done, export — and all masks become separate occlusion cards automatically.

This workflow dramatically speeds up making cards from visual materials with lots of labels or sub-parts.

## 📖 Usage

### Create Multiple Image Occlusion Cards

1. Open a card in the **card editor**  
2. Insert your target image (diagram, chart, etc.)  
3. From the editor menu, select **AI Masker / Grouped Occlusion**  
4. Draw rectangles over all parts you want to mask  
5. Click **Export / Create Cards**  
6. New occlusion cards will be generated for each mask

## ⚙️ Tips & Best Practices

- Use with **high-resolution images** for clear occlusions.  
- For diagrams with many labels, mask in **logical chunks** (e.g., regions rather than tiny text).  
- You can edit mask positions before exporting.  
- After export, tweak the card templates if you want custom style or formatting.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Masks aren’t exporting | Ensure the image is saved and visible in the editor |
| Occlusion cards overlap | Adjust mask placements manually |
| Add-on not visible | Restart Anki or reinstall from AnkiWeb |
| Exported cards missing fields | Make sure your note type has the occlusion fields |
